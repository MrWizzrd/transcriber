# Transcription Cleaning and Formatting Instructions

Your task is to clean and format the provided transcription of a trading video. Follow these guidelines:

1. Remove all irrelevant information that does not directly relate to trading.

2. Focus on extracting and organizing the following types of information:
   - Trading rules and principles
   - Trading tips and strategies
   - Instructions on how to trade
   - Guidance on how to practice trading
   - Specific trading patterns or setups (e.g., "double tops take the low")

3. Format the extracted information into clear, concise instructions or bullet points.

4. Organize the information into the following sections:
   ## Trading Rules
   ## Trading Strategies
   ## How to Trade
   ## Practice Techniques
   ## Key Patterns and Setups

5. Use bullet points for lists of tips or steps.

6. Use numbered lists for sequential instructions or processes.

7. Bold important terms or concepts.

8. If there are any specific examples or case studies mentioned, include them in a separate section labeled "Examples".

9. If any numerical data, statistics, or specific figures are mentioned (e.g., success rates, profit percentages), include these in your formatted output.

10. Maintain the original language and terminology used in the video, but clarify any jargon if possible.

11. If the speaker mentions any tools, software, or resources, include these in a separate "Resources" section at the end.

Remember, the goal is to produce a clean, well-organized document that focuses solely on trading-related information and instructions. Eliminate any off-topic discussions, personal anecdotes, or filler content that doesn't contribute to trading knowledge.
