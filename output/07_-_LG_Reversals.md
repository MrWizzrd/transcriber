# Transcription: 07 - LG Reversals.mp4

okay guys LG reversals let's go so first things first when I say reversal I mean proportionate to the time frame we're on okay it doesn't mean that we're gonna full-blown reverse the entire underlying macro trends and start moving expansively towards 100k or back down to 3k or something it just means that the swing we are in or the expansion we are in has most likely finished ie the orders have dried up and now we need to go back and rebalance to a logical level okay and then we use that for the directional tool okay I don't want people to see that this is a reversal and then they just take a setup at the top of a swing and then they think you can just short it to zero or vice versa long it to 100k because it's proportionate which means we just take it from one inefficiency to the next okay and it's the reaction around the inefficiencies or the liquidity gaps that give us an indication of where price is going next because that's all we care about okay if I'm trading direction on a 4 hour chart with a 30 minute trigger and a 2 to 5 minute entry I don't look for external range plays on a 4 hour chart because that will take days if not weeks okay I just want where price is going that day it should expand quickly if we get it right and we can be in and out in a few hours okay so without further ado let's get to it okay so this this is a nice example with this price because it's quite choppy but in choppy environments these LG reversals are almost indispensable because they give us such a clue into where price is going and or where it wants to reach for and then where it might go next okay so the LG reversal is a little bit different to what a liquidity gap is for obvious reasons because it's not technically a liquidity gap because it usually gets filled in immediately okay so I just want to look at I'm gonna ignore this big swing here because I just fucks up I hate big wicks and I don't really trade in big wicks okay so we'll take this higher low because I like the look of it okay so looking at this taking this from the high okay we swept the high into this LG here okay so we've an indication that price wants to come down yeah where does it want to go to well we've a gap there right so Once we get this up here, the 4 hour sweep within the gap, that's also an origin, okay? Nice swing. Once we get that, we can start taking trades towards this level, okay? But we lost that, so where do we go next? Well there's no gaps in here, so it's external range, which would be below this low, however, it just needed a run below the bodies because of the grab here, okay? But we came down, and we have a short bias, okay, on this move. We came to the gap, we lost it again, so the short bias remains, okay? We come down, then we get this candle, okay? I'm going to take that away. So we get this candle, and we're thinking, jeez, that's just rated the highs, bullies and golfers, sorry, bears and golfing, it's what I would call an ARC, ass rape candle, because it takes both sides of the range, and most people... think that's an easy short okay but what I want to highlight here is that the unwillingness to get below okay all we did was read the low of that ARC and then we almost engulfed it with a nice bullish close now I want to zoom in a little bit because this might be confusing it's a concept that sort of just accidentally came across when I was looking at liquidity gaps but this candle created an inefficiency okay from this low to its low okay because there was no buy side delivered there okay only sell side that's what the gap came from however once we read this low so I'm just gonna put this here for reference I'll put it on the third candle we read it that low okay after a candle like that and we closed above the inefficiency that was left with this ARC now this is a lot of the reasons why see when you see candles taking both sides of the range we know something's coming or there's a there's a move coming because all it's doing is trying to fuel the the move that we're waiting on okay it's grabbing liquidity from these highs then it went down to grab liquidity for the lows then it went down to grab more liquidity here then boom close back above yeah I think we've grabbed enough liquidity from down here that candle closed back up of this gap so now as long as this gap holds we're good for upside and where do we take upside targets to the next logical LG's okay so it's within this move now the one that we were shorting off this for sweep and I always start from the top of the swing okay that's the first gap okay we put this swing after sweeping that high engulfed it engulfed it again after a quick run above the open okay and then this run above the open created the gap because there was no price delivery on the buy side within this box okay then we came down and we created another gap because again no buy side delivery within this box we only got up to there we came back down okay I'll pull these out a bit so we've got this bullish engulfing candle okay the swing still hasn't formed but that's an indication that see this level here because that created a gap and then we engulfed it and we got right back above it then we can use that as a support level and if we hold the support port here then where do we go well first logical target this LG okay now I see there's a few little intricate things here that there's no gap in there in that candle and because that high would have rebalanced like any gap in there there's no gap okay there are usually two gaps within a swing okay so if you see if and complete when I say swing I mean like a full proportionate market cycle okay so if we're on a 30-minute chart we'll get an impulse which is normally the the efficient phase where we get lots of rebalancing lots of rebalancing with higher highs and higher lows or lower lows and lower highs then we get a run followed by a very inefficient move because the the balance price acts and the efficiency within that area price was accumulation okay that's exactly what it is then the accumulation has been done the liquidity has been fueled the rocket ship's ready to go then we get the big inefficient move okay which leaves big price gaps okay then we'll go into a consolidation okay and again this is just you could say it's accumulation for the next run and then we get one final run which will normally grab liquidity from higher up then we'll see some sort of run on that high as a as a sort of fuel injection for the downside rebalancing and then we just continue doing that okay if we're expanding to the upside then we're looking for higher lows into gaps if we're expanding the downside then we're looking for lower highs in the caps okay reversals i just stay away from i'd rather just wait for a high time frame low to be run a market structure shift and then just let the price come to us for the higher low low high okay but sorry I'm rambling so we've got this swing okay the swing formed here and this is a really nice swing because we've now got a clear line in the sand that price will not close below okay rate it engulfed around the high well nearly engulfed around the high once it runs the high we have to come down for some more liquidity and again this is accumulation we have a big ARC rate of the low okay another run down to this level okay held above it inside bar higher low bullish engulfing higher low and then we start the expansion so this is the accumulation within the initial swing okay boom expand then we go into the consolidation there's the big inefficient move I was referencing boom big price gap left then we go into consolidation again one final move and then we come back and we rebalance. Where to? Price gap. Okay so back to back to what I was talking about. We formed the swing we're confident this is support level our first logical target is here okay so the reason why I can take a long at this supposed support level is because of this candle that created that inefficiency initially that was immediately rebalanced and closed through okay that's why I call it a reversal because in an efficient well if say we're trending down okay we'll see it inefficiencies failed followed by further expansion in the direction of the trend which in this instance you would expect that level to hold as resistance then okay hope that makes sense so this is why I call it a reversal because we are reversing this move here and why are we reversing it because now we need to go up and pick up some more orders up here and the way I skin the cat here is that I'll take a trade from here to this level towards there and then get the fuck out what happens at this level then gives me further data to suggest whether we go to this level or whether we go to the high okay and you can see this candle closed above it okay when we close above this liquidity gap where do we go next this one's awkward because literally did it straight away but we closed above this one okay so now what do we wait for if this is no expansion because we took this is a reversal this was the trend that was reversing and we got above this gap we want to go to this one so what do we need we need a rebalancing or a retracement we've got a quick one there into this price gap here so now if I take this away because it's been closed through I'll actually just put a horizontal on so you can see for reference okay so and this just okay so we got above this this full gap okay we came down to rebalance now we had a liquidity gap to the downside where there was an imbalance between the buy and sell flows here okay came back down but now we didn't fully fill it but the EQ held which is the most important level on any chart on any concept EQ held and we continued okay so if we're looking to get say for example we took a long down here okay we've got a nice long boom target hit we're thinking right we got above this now so my next trade should still be to the long side so we come and rebalance we expand now we expand it through this level okay so where do we go we go to the high keep it simple guys okay so we get above this there are no other liquidity gaps so we go for the high this turns into an external range play once all liquidity gaps are filled okay so we no longer need that however i'll put another horizontal on because again you can see it acting as support there swing formed now there was no lg reversal in there which is why i'm working off this one but this i'll make them pink so you can see okay pink lg reversal no lg reversal there why because the rebalancing didn't create any inefficiency at all because the efficient price action there rebalanced and that was enough because we get a higher low okay and then that engulfing created the low at the EQ. Closed above this so we're still on for longs where do we want to go for longs well we've got this liquidity gap here okay once this candle closes creates the gap then we came in and tested the previous level okay and you see this candle again didn't take both sides of the range but a swing high formed and there was an inefficiency there okay now look what happened here so rate of the low boom close above retest higher low higher low boom okay this inefficiency was created rate the low close above retest retest higher low higher low expansion this shit happens all the fucking time the point where I've classified everything that it's all almost you can count the number of candles in the trend as long as it's proportionate so the same thing happened if I mark this low and I'll make it red so okay the mechanics of this reversal and the mechanics of this reversal are exactly the same if you notice if I just take all of this shit away you know don't really need okay so I'll keep that on because that was our target as soon as we get this close above this becomes the target because there's no other LG's we just need to be patient and wait for the swing to form wait for this read okay I guarantee that's a 30-minute sweep let's just see 20th of June okay sorry I'm going off topic again, there, sweep, ARC, sweep, yep, another sweep there, higher low, send it. It's just, it's mad how easy this shit is when you master it. Okay, so, we've now got an LG reversal down here, okay, and I can take that easily as expansion because we got the higher low, higher low support, boom, gap created there, quick rebalance, another inefficient move, then we go for the consolidation, which is all efficient price action, that's where we're fueling, boom, another one, another gap, we've gap there, created, gap there, created, gap there, created, this is expansion, okay, so as soon as we get through this LG, we just wait for the raid, and that raid was a 30 minute sweep, so when we go through entry techniques, we can get you on board these trades, and yes, the target's only at the high, but who gives a fuck? like say we take it from the level just it's three and a half percent okay we take it say we took it from this level and we were just taking it up to the first LG it's five and a half percent as well you know in a couple of days okay so we're now above I'll just work through this for a little bit and look at a downside reversal because I want to use this high we are above swing high okay and well we got this nice bullish push swing formed we engulfed the um do you see there was no gap okay why that was a read okay we have the high where's the gap down here okay so this was the candle that left the inside efficiency that was then closed through okay so there's that candle there confirms the reversal then we start to look at where the gaps are well there's a gap there okay if I pull that across where did we go but that candle closed through it so where do you think our next target is now again just like we're taking this from the below just to the target and then we got another trade here to the high we're getting reversal here we wait for the pullback aim for the gap with a gap fill okay once we lose it wait for another retracement and a rebalancing and then we aim for the next gap so now we can start to look at these smaller gaps that were left okay so we had a gap here otherwise there are no other gaps here that gap let me just check hi 298 low was 361 okay so there is a tiny gap in there let me get pink soon so because that's so close to this one i'll take that away but let's move this out a little bit so now we've lost this gap okay so all i want to see is a run okay a rebalancing and then we take trades in the direction of this lg and then we reassess once we get there okay reactive not anticipatory and if i just oh fuck sake so we lost the gap here then we formed a swing okay now this is how i stay out of a lot of losers i'm going to show you this and then i'll cut it because this is went forward too long okay but we lost the gap here using that candle so my bias is now short okay but then what happens we form a swing here we sweep the low okay and then what do we get see that candle does that look familiar ARC rate of a low on what we have here another LG reversal after the rate of the low support boom hello hello support rate of the low expansion okay so see when I see this shorter off the table why because we've had an LG reversal to the upside which means where are we going to the next logical liquidity gap okay now technically there's one here so we get that clues above here we just were on the lower time frames waiting for the read you could take it there to there again it's not much but those are the type of moves that I'll take all day there's not a 3% okay take 30 of those trades a month you've doubled an account well if you have 100% strike rate but we've got above this okay this candle so because we got above this I'm still short biased okay because this LG is getting filled but I just need to wait a little longer because we got above this line now this is where I don't want to talk too much about quite a trend trading because we haven't perfected with trend trading but a lot of the time when I see that I'll just take smaller targets okay so if say we're getting 3R from here I'll just take that for one and a half so we're only looking for half of the proportionate move knowing that it's counter trend okay so we could close above I'm still off shorts are off the table okay so then we need to look at the next logical area so see this area here above a high from the nice swing and we got the LG reversal there the candle that formed the LG reversal also created a gap here okay so that's something we need to be aware of why because that could be an area price would want the rebounds to okay pull that across slightly and let's see what happens boom so now we've got above this one here there's the raid okay raid swing formed and then we go for there so we could take another counter trend there up to here okay now this is where we've taken our profits because we were long here we longed it to there okay we closed above it rated there we longed it into the gap now we wait for a further reaction now this is where I'm thinking this gaps fucking ready to be taken and I've got a big expansive move ready okay all I need is an entry because now we've got well say we take it from up here we've not got a 10% move to fill this gap so in my thought process I'm looking at right if I get the setup here balls deep double risk or I use a dynamic risk profile based on how far away I think price is going Now you might argue that there's gaps here and here which absolutely take your profits at the next logical LG however we lost this LG okay we're still within the range of this move so we have to fill this in absolutely have to okay so see up here I've just seen a four sweep okay boom it was also an ARC took both sides of the range now we didn't get any three tier reversals there but there's a gap here look what happened the next candle so we'll get that pink and lost it okay three tier reversal so see this candle here now I've confirmed that well this gaps lost we're heading towards this gap we might get a little bit of consolidation on a rebalance okay but there's my ultimate target and that's why I sort of worked through this chart that this is the range we're in okay this move down was a rebalancing towards this gap but we also lost the gap which means it's no longer a rebalance that's an expansion what do we want to see off an expansion a rebalance where does the rebalance go to a liquidity gap what is this it's a lower high or a lower high sweep which is my bread and butter okay so this candle I could have been aggressive and said right that's swept it's an ARC closed below the low of the previous candle and we've put up a pretty bullish move in okay so this looks like a possible reversal so if you want to be aggressive you can take a short up here target down there okay again that's 10% once we close below there that to me that's confirmed all I need to see now is a sweep a raid or a 1-2-3 okay so even if we look from from this candle that's still 7% okay you can take profits here for sure take half off here let the rest run move your stop the break even okay simple now it won't always work that way but whatever I want to leave that that part up to you so when we get the risk management and take profits and stuff that's gonna be all on you guys because I have a very specific way of doing things now and it's not the same as the way I did it last year or the year before and everyone has different risk parameters based on psychology I'm risk averse so 2% risk to me is huge and I'll only take high risk trades if I'm 100% confident like this for example soon as I close below I'd be shorting that all the way down and it's as simple as that so let's move on we've got our short or we've not got a short but we've now got a short bias back on so this move here we've got a couple of nice trades this move here we've got a couple of nice trades this move here we could have had a few counter trends but it's happy to just leave it I know it's maybe three or four days of price action but see when you wait for this one and you know this looks juicy because we've just filled the gap we fail to close above it we swept the level with an ARC that's crying just to fill this gap then we get a an absolute huge expansive candle through this liquidity gap confirms our three or sorry our LG reversal and then we just any opportunity in the lower time frames to short we're shorting to here okay so let's just see what happens okay so we got that little like shitty inside bar kind of thing and then we got another ARC okay we're at the high we're at the low now what happened again we rated this low okay and we got a pretty expansive candle so now if we took a short up here this might scare us because look what happened it's an LG reversal but what's it reversing or where's it reversing at reversing at this gap okay but we lost that gap so we know that this reversal is more likely a rebalancing where's it gonna rebalance the gap up here it's actually quite a large gap now okay here so where do you think we'll rebalance do you know we don't have to but there's the logical level okay Remember what I said about using this level as resistance we can easily just Form a swing and then roll over from there. So that's a point to note But I'm into the gap. Oh, where did the high air see wonder what comes next? Sweep I fucking hope that's a sweep. Oh, fuck. That's not a sweep, right? Um, I was trying to be a Be a deuce there Uh, it's not a sweep But it's a lower high. Okay, and It's into this gap, okay so whoops We came into the gap. Look at the beauty of the eq. Okay, we did the high arc. That's a good sign that this could be the Determination we also reversed back down Okay, so we're back on for shorts again And then we just come up for the lower high. So this was a little messy Okay, but as soon as we got this Upside three LG reversal, then we look at this LG for a breakdown. We got the three The LG reversal and Then we came up for more liquidity Okay within this LG and we didn't run the high which is what I was hoping to happen there And then we came down. Where did we go? To the tech nearly. Okay. Now that's a front run Levels don't get front run okay, so We'll work through this a little bit and then I'll call this because this is getting mental With an LG reversal here You can just see how pivotal these levels are because smash smash smash smash smash boom That's accumulation, okay, that's not resistance holding it's accumulation swing formed higher low formed okay further higher low formed higher low within a higher low within a higher low again you don't want to short that so we got above this level so where's the liquidity gap well we closed above that i'm not going to mark it which means if i'm looking for shorts where do i look for shorts okay eq boom rated to high and again this lg reversal here a bit like this one we reversed back down on ourselves and then we came up for another run okay so that one might have actually fucked us but not to worry we rated that high we reversed again the lg reversal here with a nice big expanse of candle so say we got fucked here okay we got a nice retest of the EQ and we're thinking right target down there I'm taking any anything I can on lower timeframes here we may have got fucked but that's fine losses happen it's not a 100% strike rate strategy it can be a 95% strike rate strategy if you play your cards right though and so then you just take this one simple as that we've got another reversal there so as soon as that candle closes there's our target and then finally we get there okay and what happens we lose it so what happens when we lose it we caught the rebalance where do we balance well well there wasn't really a gap in there but we came into that origin okay which was within this candle that created the last liquidity gap okay I'll just mark it out so you can see now it should be the body actually there and shits and giggles look at the respect okay sweep at the eq take that all day now we've lost this becomes an external range play because this low gets targeted right no other lgs there no other lgs there so do we target this one or this one it's completely up to you but as you can see we know what happened because we came down onto this low for the higher low of this okay so that's lg reversals i hope that was um helpful i had no plans for doing an lg reversal video so hopefully that was insightful and it gives you a little more and doesn't confuse you further okay but you'll see how these things as i've said a million times all i do is swing the swing but it's easy spotting swings but it's hard to trade them so we need concepts like this okay like the lg reversal the rate of the low okay and the liquidity gaps that we're targeting you can see above above highs we short okay below lows we long it sounds counterintuitive because most people think if we're moving up we want long but no we get above this high we put in an LG reversal we left the gap the literal candle that created the LG reversal was the candle we came to rebalance to okay and then that's where we've got the sweep you'll see that a lot so in terms of what I would would hope you guys can can do with this information is mark out these swings okay our four hours are direction charts so these swings give us clues into where price is going so that's the direction we trade in it's not that we just blindly market these things because as you can see they come back themselves, it's just the indication that we close through the LG that formed the swing high or the swing low, we go to the next liquidity gap, if there's one left we go to the next low or high, keep it simple. So I hope that was helpful guys, chat soon.
